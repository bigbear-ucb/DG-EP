# XTrans

This is my personal project to do neutronics calculation using finite element methods.

The skeleton is based on STL C++ with the third-party library [deal.II](http://www.dealii.org/). deal.II provides MPI wrapper functions and PETSc functionalities for SparseMatrix, Vector, preconditioners and solvers.

Now, this XTrans project become the C++ core part of the Project "Bay-Area Radiation Transport code", or [BART](https://github.com/SlaybaughLab/BART) at UC Berkeley. (PI: [Rachel Slaybaugh](https://github.com/rachelslaybaugh))

This project will not be discontinued but will be investigating new implementations and as a reference for BART implementation.
